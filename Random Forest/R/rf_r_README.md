1. Install Required R Packages
Ensure that you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them by running the following commands in your R environment:

```
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("tictoc")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("ranger")
install.packages("kernlab")
install.packages("brnn")
install.packages("neuralnet")
install.packages("NeuralNetTools")
install.packages("nnet")
install.packages("RSNNS")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("doParallel")
install.packages("hms")
```
2. Load and Prepare Data
Your data is stored in multiple CSV files, and the script concatenates them into a single dataset.

Reading Data:

```
df <- read_csv("/TrainData/")
```
Filtering Data by PearsonR:

Filter rows where PearsonR is 0.7 or higher:

```
df <- df[df$PearsonR >= 0.7,]
```
3. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using the createDataPartition function:

```
set.seed(42)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(df$epa_pm25, p = .7, list = FALSE, times = 1)

train <- df[trainIndex,]
test <- df[-trainIndex,]

train_x <- train[c("pm25_cf_1", "temperature", "humidity")]
test_x <- test[c("pm25_cf_1", "temperature", "humidity")]
```
4. Standardize the Data
To ensure consistent scaling across features, standardize the training and testing sets using the scale function:

```
train_x <- scale(train_x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
test_x <- scale(test_x, center = attr(train_x, "scaled:center"), scale = attr(train_x, "scaled:scale"))

train_x <- train_x %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(epa_pm25 = train$epa_pm25)
test_x <- test_x %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(epa_pm25 = test$epa_pm25)
```
5. Train Random Forest Models
You train the Random Forest model (ranger method) for 10 iterations, and track the time taken for training and prediction:

Model Training:

```
rf_grid <- expand.grid(mtry = 3, splitrule = c("variance"), min.node.size = 1)
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "none")
test_results <- tibble()

for(i in c(1:10)){
  time_start <- Sys.time()
  rf_model_pm <- caret::train(epa_pm25 ~ ., data = train_x, method = "ranger", tuneGrid = rf_grid, trControl = fitControl)
  time_end <- Sys.time()
  time_tr_1 <- as_hms(time_end - time_start)

  # Save the model
  write_rds(rf_model_pm, str_c("/output_models/rf_n_model_01_05_70_30_", i))

  # Test the model and capture prediction time
  time_start <- Sys.time()
  rf_n_pred_pm <- predict(rf_model_pm, test_x)
  time_end <- Sys.time()
  time_pred_1 <- as_hms(time_end - time_start)

  # Calculate metrics
  rf_n_metric_pm <- postResample(pred = rf_n_pred_pm, obs = test_x$epa_pm25)
  rf_n_mertric_df_pm <- data.frame(as.list(rf_n_metric_pm))
  
  test_results <- rbind(test_results, rf_n_mertric_df_pm)
  
  time_trains <- c(time_trains, as.character(time_tr_1))
  time_pred <- c(time_pred, as.character(time_pred_1))
  print(str_c("completed model ", i, " of 10"))
}
```
6. Aggregate Results
Calculate the average RMSE, RÂ², and MAE across the 10 models, along with the average training and prediction times:

```
test_results <- test_results %>%
  mutate(model = c(1:nrow(test_results)), time_train = time_trains, time_pred = time_pred) %>%
  mutate(type = "single")

test_results_ag <- test_results %>%
  summarize(RMSE = mean(RMSE), Rsquared = mean(Rsquared), MAE = mean(MAE),
            time_pred = mean(time_pred), time_train = mean(time_train)) %>%
  mutate(model = NA, type = "agg")
```
7. Save Results
Save to CSV:

```
test_sum <- rbind(test_results, test_results_ag)
write_csv(test_sum, "/output/rf_n_pm_results_01_05_70_30.csv")
```
Save to Text File:

```
file.create("/output/rf_n_pm_results_01_05_70_30.txt")
file_con <- "/output/rf_n_pm_results_01_05_70_30.txt"
write_lines("rf_n results", file = file_con)

for(i in c(1:10)){
  write_lines(str_c("Model ", i, " : RMSE = ", test_results$RMSE[i], " R^2 = ", test_results$Rsquared[i]), file = file_con, append = TRUE)
}
write_lines(str_c("Aggregate Model ", " : RMSE = ", test_results_ag$RMSE, " R^2 = ", test_results_ag$Rsquared), file = file_con, append = TRUE)
```
8. Running the Script
Once the setup is complete, run the script in your R environment. The results will be saved in both a CSV file and a text file with detailed metrics for each model and the aggregate results.
