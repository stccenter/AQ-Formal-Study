1. Install Required R Packages
Ensure that the necessary R packages are installed by running the following commands in your R environment:

```
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("tictoc")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("kernlab")
install.packages("brnn")
install.packages("RSNNS")
install.packages("e1071")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("hms")
```
2. Load and Prepare Data
Your data is stored in multiple CSV files, and the script consolidates them into a single dataset.
Reading Data:

```
df <- read_csv("/TrainData/")
```
Filtering Data by PearsonR:

Filter rows where PearsonR is 0.7 or higher:

```
df <- df[df$PearsonR >= 0.7,]
```
3. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using the createDataPartition function:

```
set.seed(42)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(df$epa_pm25, p = .8, list = FALSE, times = 1)

train <- df[trainIndex,]
test <- df[-trainIndex,]

train_x <- train[c("pm25_cf_1", "temperature", "humidity")]
test_x <- test[c("pm25_cf_1", "temperature", "humidity")]
```
4. Standardize the Data
To ensure the data is on the same scale, standardize the training and testing sets using the scale function:

```
train_x <- scale(train_x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
test_x <- scale(test_x, center = attr(train_x, "scaled:center"), scale = attr(train_x, "scaled:scale"))

train_x <- train_x %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(epa_pm25 = train$epa_pm25)
test_x <- test_x %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(epa_pm25 = test$epa_pm25)
```
5. Train SVM Models
You train the SVM model (svm function from the e1071 package) for multiple iterations while tracking the time taken for training and prediction. After training, each model is saved, and metrics are calculated.

Model Training and Prediction:

```
test_results <- tibble()
time_trains <- NULL
time_pred <- NULL

for(i in c(1:2)){
  # Train the model and track time taken
  time_start <- Sys.time()
  svm_model_pm <- svm(epa_pm25 ~ ., data = train_x)
  time_end <- Sys.time()
  time_tr_1 <- as_hms(time_end - time_start)
  
  # Save the model
  write_rds(svm_model_pm, str_c("/output_models/svm_model_12_15_", i))
  svm_model_pm <- read_rds("C:/PATH/svm_model_12_15_2")
  
  # Test the model and capture prediction time
  time_start <- Sys.time()
  svm_pred_pm <- predict(svm_model_pm, test_x)
  time_end <- Sys.time()
  time_pred_1 <- as_hms(time_end - time_start)
  
  # Calculate performance metrics
  svm_metric_pm <- postResample(pred = svm_pred_pm, obs = test_x$epa_pm25)
  svm_mertric_df_pm <- data.frame(as.list(svm_metric_pm))
  
  # Append results
  test_results <- rbind(test_results, svm_mertric_df_pm)
  
  # Append train and test timing
  time_trains <- c(time_trains, as.character(time_tr_1))
  time_pred <- c(time_pred, as.character(time_pred_1))
  
  print(str_c("completed model ", i, " of 2"))
}
```
6. Aggregate Results
After training all models, calculate the average RMSE, RÂ², and MAE, along with the average training and prediction times:

```
test_results <- test_results %>%
  mutate(model = c(1:nrow(test_results)), time_train = time_trains, time_pred = time_pred) %>%
  mutate(type = "single")

test_results_ag <- test_results %>%
  summarize(RMSE = mean(RMSE), Rsquared = mean(Rsquared), MAE = mean(MAE),
            time_pred = as_hms(mean(as_hms(time_pred))), time_train = as_hms(mean(as_hms(time_train)))) %>%
  mutate(model = NA, type = "agg")
```
7. Save Results
Save to CSV:

```
test_sum <- rbind(test_results, test_results_ag)
write_csv(test_sum, "/output/svm_pm_results_12_15.csv")
```
Save to Text File:

```
file.create("/output/svm_pm_results_12_15.txt")
file_con <- "/output/svm_pm_results_12_15.txt"
write_lines("svm results", file = file_con)

for(i in c(1:(nrow(test_sum)-1))){
  write_lines(str_c("Model ", i, " : RMSE = ", test_results$RMSE[i], " R^2 = ", test_results$Rsquared[i]), file = file_con, append = TRUE)
}
write_lines(str_c("Aggregate Model ", " : RMSE = ", test_results_ag$RMSE, " R^2 = ", test_results_ag$Rsquared), file = file_con, append = TRUE)
```
8. Running the Script
Once the setup is complete, run the script in your R environment. The results will be saved as both a CSV file and a text file, with detailed model performance metrics for each model and the aggregate results.
